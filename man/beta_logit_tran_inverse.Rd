\title{Inverse Beta Logit Transformation (Optimized with C Integration)}
\usage{
beta_logit_tran_inverse(z, bl4)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{A numeric vector or matrix representing the transformed data to be
back-transformed to its original bounded scale.}

\item{bl4}{A numeric vector of length four containing the transformation
parameters: the lower (`a`) and upper (`b`) bounds of the original data's
domain, and the `b1` and `b2` shape parameters for the beta distribution.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector or matrix (same dimensions as `z`), containing the
back-transformed values, allowing results to be interpreted on the original
scale of the data.
}
\description{
Converts a numeric vector or matrix `z` back from an unbounded
range to its original bounded domain. This optimized version leverages a
C function for performance gains, especially when handling large datasets.
The transformation reverses the beta logit process applied in
`beta_logit_tran`, using the inverse logit function and the inverse beta
cumulative distribution, with scaling defined by `a` and `b`.
}
\details{
The inverse transformation consists of the following steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Apply the inverse logit function to `z`, mapping it to the (0,1) range.
  \item Use the beta quantile function (inverse cumulative distribution)
        with shape parameters `b1` and `b2`.
  \item Scale the values back to the original data's bounded domain, defined
        by the lower (`a`) and upper (`b`) bounds.
}
By integrating with C, this function is designed to efficiently handle large
numeric vectors and matrices, making it suitable for high-performance data
transformations in complex analyses.
