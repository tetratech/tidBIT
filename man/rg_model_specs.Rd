as the job begins.}

\item{run_time_stop}{The stop time of the modeling job, recorded once the job
completes.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns for each key aspect of the job's specifications
 and runtime details, formatted for readability and further analysis.
}
\description{
Constructs a tibble containing detailed specifications of a
modeling job, including the selected subestuary, water quality variable, data
source, time range, and runtime information. This function organizes the job
